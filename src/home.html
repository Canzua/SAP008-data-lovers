              <p class="container-text">C-137, is one of the many universes in the multiverse and the universe where the mainstream Rick and Morty are often identified as Natives. Dimension C-137 is supposedly the universe in which Earth was invaded by Cronenbergs (Alien Race).<br>
                  <strong>Inspiration:</strong> David Cronenberg (Canadian film director), is called by the press and the public as the "King of Venereal Horror" or "Blood Baron", Cronenberg is undoubtedly a master in horror, an area of ​​cinema that dominates as few, and that explores using mutations, parasites and diseases as "triggers", exploring dark environments and explicit visual references to the degradation of the body and flesh.<br>
                  <strong>Curiosity:</strong> C-137 is also the name given to cesium-137, a radioactive isotope of cesium, which has a mass number (A) equal to 137, as it corresponds to the sum of the number of protons (55) and neutrons ( 82).
